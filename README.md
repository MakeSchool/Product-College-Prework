# Product College Prework

Welcome to the Product College!

During the first week of the Product College, you will take a few assessments to see if you can skip some initial classes. This document contains links to some tutorials and videos that will prepare you for these assessments.

By completing this prework, you will accelerate your time becoming a software engineer, and can even make it so your can graduate from the Product College early. If you do not complete this prework, you will not be "in trouble" but you might be discouraged by being less prepared than other students which will make your time more difficult.

You may already possess the skills and knowledge to "test out" of these classes. Or you may not. Either way, it is important for you to review and complete the following prework to level up your skills.

The primary languages that you will learn at the Product College are Python (for CS) and either JavaScript (for web) or Swift (for mobile). This prework focuses on these languages and the major paradigms for web and mobile development.


## Professional Success

1. Read [How to make a LinkedIn page that wows recruiters, according to the guy who just overhauled its design](https://amp-businessinsider-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/amp.businessinsider.com/how-to-best-use-your-linkedin-page-2017-3) (10 min)
1. Update and/or create your [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)


## Computer Science Foundations

1. Watch [13 Types of Software Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9ZS6q4996g) (Video - 10 min)
1. Watch [How Code Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI0KumcNTak&list=PLVpAurZqkV67DYxp5L8bx1g1yzE2hTe8m) (Video - 13 min)

### Git and GitHub

Complete [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) (1 hour) to learn the basics of Git version control with a guided tutorial.

For more information, check out [Learn Version Control with Git](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/) videos and tutorials. You don't need to finish this, watching [videos 1-8](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/videos#episodes) and/or reading [part 1 of the tutorial](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/introduction) is enough for now.

Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account (if you don't have one yet) and complete your profile (name, photo, etc).

### Python

*The most important thing is to become familiar with Python by practicing programming. Remember that reading is not enough. You must practice to learn a new language.*

Complete [Try Python](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-python) (2 hours), a gentle introductory tutorial to the language with fun videos.

Complete 10-15 of [HackerRank’s Python Challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python/py-introduction) (2-4 hours), which automatically test all your code submissions for correctness. The introduction, basic data types, strings, and classes sections cover what you need to know.

*Commit your code to a Git repository as you work on these to show your learning progress and practice using Git. Don't wait to commit all your work at the end – you should get in the habit of making frequent commits, like professional software developers.*

Another good place to learn is the [Official Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/), which has short code examples that you can follow along with by typing them into an interactive Python shell to see the results.

For more guidance, check out [Google’s Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/), a free tutorial course teaching the basics with videos and exercises. The introduction, strings, lists, sorting, and dictionaries sections cover what you need to know. But first, be sure to [install Python 2.7 the right way](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/) to save yourself the trouble/confusion/pain later. Basically, this involves using Homebrew to correctly install and link Python and PIP commands.

### Object-Oriented Programming

Watch [Object Oriented Programing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUlHun5a430&list=PLVpAurZqkV67DYxp5L8bx1g1yzE2hTe8m&index=7) by Dave Xiang (10 minutes) for a quick video overview of ideas.

Read [An Introduction to Classes and Inheritance](http://www.jesshamrick.com/2011/05/18/an-introduction-to-classes-and-inheritance-in-python/) (20 minutes), an excellent blog post that gives a short, basic introduction to the OOP concepts of classes and inheritance using Python.

Complete Make School's [OOP Coding Challenge](http://hr.gs/ooptest) (1-2 hours), a fun story-driven tutorial that teaches the major concepts of OOP (classes, objects, instance methods, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition). You can complete it in Swift, Python, JavaScript, Java, or C++; I recommend you try it in Python.
