# PC Prework

Welcome to the Product College!

During the first week of the Product College, you will take a few tests to see if you can skip some initial classes. This document contains links to some tutorials and videos that will prepare you for these tests.

By completing this prework, you will accelerate your time becoming a software engineer, and can even make it so your can graduate from the Product College early. If you do not complete this prework, you will not be "in trouble" but you might be discouraged by being less prepared than other fellows which will make your time more difficult.

You may already possess the skills and knowledge to "test out" of these classes. Or you may not. Either way, it is important for you to review and complete the following prework.

The primary languages that you will learn at the Product College are Python and either JavaScript (for Web) or Swift (for mobile). This prework focuses on these languages and the major paradigms for web and mobile development.
